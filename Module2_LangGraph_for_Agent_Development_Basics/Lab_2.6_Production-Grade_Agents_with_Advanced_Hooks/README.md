# ü§ñ Module 2: Production-Grade Agents with Advanced Hooks

Welcome to **Module 2**! In this section, we take your agent-building skills from basic prototypes to **robust, production-ready systems**.  

Here, you'll explore **LangGraph‚Äôs advanced features**, focusing on:

- **Custom State Management**
- **Pre-Model and Post-Model Hooks**
- **Security, Guardrails, and Context-Aware Agents**

These features allow you to **intercept and modify an agent's behavior** at critical points, enabling highly **secure, context-aware, and efficient AI assistants**.

## üß† Core Concepts You Will Master

> **üí° Advanced State Management**  
> Go beyond simple message lists. Build a **rich, custom state object** to track:
> - User roles  
> - Conversation summaries  
> - Security flags  

> **üí° Pre-Model Hooks**  
> Execute logic **before calling the LLM** to:
> - Dynamically inject context into prompts  
> - Summarize long conversations  
> - Choose models based on query complexity  

> **üí° Post-Model Hooks**  
> Run code **after LLM response but before delivery** to:
> - Enforce guardrails  
> - Moderate content  
> - Detect PII  
> - Apply conditional approval workflows

## üèó Labs in This Module

| Lab | Focus | Description |
|-----|-------|-------------|
| **2.1** | Advanced State Management | Define and use a **custom state schema** for the HR agent. |
| **2.2** | Dynamic Prompts with Pre-Model Hooks | Inject **context-aware instructions** and select LLMs dynamically. |
| **2.3** | Conversation Management | Summarize long-running conversations efficiently. |
| **2.4** | Guardrails & Workflows | Build **PII detection guardrails** and conditional workflows. |
| **2.5** | Fully Integrated System | Combine all techniques into a **production-ready HR agent**. |

## üöÄ How to Get Started

1. **Open in Google Colab**  
   Enjoy a **zero-setup experience**.  

2. **Set API Key**  
   Create a `.env` file and add your `OPENAI_API_KEY`, or set it via **Colab Secrets**.  

3. **Run Each Lab**  
   Execute each Python script sequentially. Observe **agent behavior, hooks, and guardrails in action**.  

4. **Analyze Results**  
   Carefully review output to understand **pre/post-model hooks, dynamic state updates, and escalations**.

## ‚ö° Pro Tips

- Use **interactive experimentation** in Colab to test edge cases like **PII requests, role-based responses, or long conversation summaries**.  
- Pay attention to **state schema** and **hook ordering**, as they define how your agent reacts in real-time.  
- Think of each lab as a **building block**: mastering one ensures success in the fully integrated system in **Lab 2.5**.
