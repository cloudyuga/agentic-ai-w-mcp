    "\n",
    "## What is Runtime?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Runtime** is the execution environment where your agent runs. It provides:\n",
    "- **Context**: Static information available during execution\n",
    "- **Store**: Long-term memory (covered in next module)\n",
    "- **Stream Writer**: Custom streaming updates\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Context?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context** is information that **doesn't change during a conversation** but is essential for the agent to work:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Example without Context:\n",
    "User: \"Show my leave balance\"\n",
    "Agent: \"I don't know who you are!\" ❌\n",
    "\n",
    "Example with Context:\n",
    "Context: {user_id: \"101\", name: \"Priya Sharma\", dept: \"Engineering\"}\n",
    "User: \"Show my leave balance\"\n",
    "Agent: \"Priya, you have 12 days remaining\" ✅\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Context vs Messages\n",
    "\n",
    "| Messages | Context |\n",
    "|----------|--------|\n",
    "| Changes during conversation | Static during conversation |\n",
    "| User: \"Hello\", Agent: \"Hi!\" | user_id, org_id, api_keys |\n",
    "| Short-term memory | Configuration |\n",
    "| \"What did I just say?\" | \"Who am I?\" |\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**The LLM does NOT automatically see context!** Context is only accessible to:\n",

    "# Summary & Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "## What We Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Runtime & Context**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@dataclass\n",
    "class Context:\n",
    "    user_id: str\n",
    "    database_url: str\n",
    "\n",
    "agent = create_agent(\n",
    "    context_schema=Context,\n",
    "    ...\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "agent.invoke({...}, context=Context(...))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Tools with Context-Aware Parameters**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Tools take explicit parameters\n",
    "@tool\n",
    "def get_user_data(user_id: str) -> str:\n",
    "    return f\"Data for {user_id}\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Dynamic prompt tells LLM which values to use\n",
    "@dynamic_prompt\n",
    "def inject_context(request: ModelRequest) -> str:\n",
    "    user_id = request.runtime.context.user_id\n",
    "    return f\"Current user ID is {user_id}. Use this when calling tools.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Dynamic Prompts**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@dynamic_prompt\n",
    "def my_prompt(request: ModelRequest) -> str:\n",
    "    name = request.runtime.context.user_name\n",
    "    return f\"You are helping {name}\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Middleware Hooks**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@before_model\n",
    "def log_request(state: AgentState, runtime: Runtime[Context]) -> dict | None:\n",
    "    # Pre-processing\n",
    "    return None\n",
    "\n",
    "@after_model\n",
    "def log_response(state: AgentState, runtime: Runtime[Context]) -> dict | None:\n",
    "    # Post-processing\n",
    "    return None\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔑 Critical Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "**The LLM does NOT automatically see context!**\n",
    "\n",
    "Context must be explicitly injected:\n",
    "- ✅ **In Tools** - `runtime.context.field_name`\n",
    "- ✅ **In Dynamic Prompts** - `request.runtime.context.field_name`\n",
    "- ✅ **In Middleware** - `runtime.context.field_name`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Context vs Messages vs Store\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature | Context | Messages | Store (Next Module) |\n",
    "|---------|---------|----------|--------------------|\n",
    "| **What** | Static config | Conversation | Long-term memory |\n",
    "| **When** | Per invocation | During chat | Across sessions |\n",
    "| **Example** | user_id, api_key | \"Hello!\", \"Hi!\" | Preferences, history |\n",
    "| **Scope** | Single invocation | Single thread | All threads |\n",
    "| **Access** | Tools, prompts, hooks | Always visible | Store API |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Production Checklist\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Define clear context schema** - What info does agent need?  \n",
    "✅ **Use dataclasses** - Type safety and IDE support  \n",
    "✅ **Inject via dynamic prompts** - For LLM to \"see\" context  \n",
    "✅ **Access in tools** - `runtime.context.field_name`  \n",
    "✅ **Dynamic prompts** - Personalize based on user role  \n",
    "✅ **Audit logging** - Use before/after hooks  \n",
    "✅ **Access control** - Check permissions in hooks  \n",
    "✅ **Combine with checkpointer** - Short-term + Context  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multi-Tenant\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@dataclass\n",
    "class TenantContext:\n",
    "    user_id: str\n",
    "    organization_id: str  # Separate data per org\n",
    "    database_url: str  # Org-specific DB\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Role-Based Behavior\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@dynamic_prompt\n",
    "def role_prompt(request: ModelRequest) -> str:\n",
    "    role = request.runtime.context.role\n",
    "    if role == \"admin\":\n",
    "        return \"You have admin access...\"\n",
    "    return \"You have user access...\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Audit Trail\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@before_model\n",
    "def audit(state, runtime):\n",
    "    log_to_db(\n",
    "        user=runtime.context.user_id,\n",
    "        query=state['messages'][-1].content,\n",
    "        timestamp=now()\n",
    "    )\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Module: Long-Term Memory (Store)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you understand **Context** (static configuration), the next module will cover **Store** (dynamic, persistent memory):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Storing user preferences across sessions\n",
    "- Learning from past interactions\n",
    "- Building knowledge over time\n",
    "- Using `InjectedStore` (similar to `InjectedToolArg`)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Difference:**\n",
    "- **Context**: \"Who is asking?\" (static, per-invocation)\n",
    "- **Store**: \"What do I remember?\" (dynamic, cross-session)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remember:** Runtime provides the environment your agent needs to work effectively!"
