        "#\n",
        "# The best approach is rarely \"agent OR workflow\"; it's \"agent AND workflow\". We use each for what it does best. An agent acts as the \"brain\" for making complex decisions, while workflows act as the \"hands\" for executing simple, reliable tasks.\n",

        "#\n",
        "# The most important part of a hybrid system is the \"handoff\"—the point where an agent passes data to a workflow, or vice versa. The data passed must be structured and predictable.\n",
        "#\n",
        "# Let's define the data for our handoff points:\n",
        "#\n",
        "# 1.  **Agent (Evaluate) → Workflow (Route)**\n",
        "#     * **Data:** A JSON object like `{\"candidate_id\": 123, \"score\": 85, \"summary\": \"Strong Python skills...\"}`.\n",
        "#     * The workflow only needs to read the `score` to do its job.\n",
        "#\n",
        "# 2.  **Workflow (Collects Feedback) → Agent (Final Decision)**\n",
        "#     * **Data:** `{\"candidate_id\": 123, \"interview_transcript\": \"...\", \"interviewer_notes\": \"...\"}`.\n",
        "#     * The agent uses this rich, unstructured data to make its nuanced final decision.\n",
        "#\n",
        "# 3.  **Agent (Final Decision) → Workflow (Send Email)**\n",
        "#     * **Data:** `{\"candidate_id\": 123, \"decision\": \"hire\", \"candidate_email\": \"jane@example.com\"}`.\n",
        "#     * The workflow uses this simple, structured data to execute its reliable task.\n",
        "#\n",

        "# Why go to the trouble of combining both?\n",
        "#\n",
        "# * **Best of Both Worlds:** You get the intelligent, adaptive reasoning of agents and the rock-solid reliability of workflows.\n",
        "# * **Efficiency:** Agents handle the complex, time-consuming cognitive tasks, freeing up humans. Workflows handle the repetitive, administrative tasks, ensuring nothing is missed.\n",
        "# * **Scalability:** You can easily add new rules to your workflows or update the knowledge of your agents without having to rebuild the entire system.\n",
        "# * **Maintainability:** It's much easier to debug a simple, rule-based workflow than it is to figure out why a complex agent made a particular decision. By separating concerns, you make the system easier to manage.\n",
