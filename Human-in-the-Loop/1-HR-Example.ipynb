    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to implement Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) workflows for HR operations using LangChain and LangGraph. HITL allows AI agents to pause execution and wait for human approval before performing sensitive actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why HITL for HR?\n",
    "\n",
    "HR operations often involve sensitive data and actions that require human oversight:\n",
    "- üí∞ **Compensation changes** - Must be reviewed by HR managers\n",
    "- üìß **Offer letters** - Need approval before sending to candidates\n",
    "- üîê **Access permissions** - Security-sensitive operations\n",
    "- üìä **Compliance actions** - Legal and regulatory requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Agent generates action** ‚Üí AI decides to use a tool\n",
    "2. **Middleware intercepts** ‚Üí Pauses execution if tool requires approval\n",
    "3. **Human reviews** ‚Üí Person accepts, edits, or rejects the action\n",
    "4. **Execution resumes** ‚Üí Based on human's decision\n",
