            "\n",
            "1. **Tailored Approaches**: It's important not to adopt a one-size-fits-all policy. Hybrid work arrangements should account for the unique needs of individual employees and teams. This approach helps in building a more inclusive and effective work environment (Web Search, March 5, 2025).\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Encouraging Face-to-Face Interaction**: While remote work offers many benefits, in-person collaboration is essential for fostering teamwork and promoting real-time interactions. Therefore, hybrid policies should encourage opportunities for employees to connect physically (Web Search, March 5, 2025).\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Managerial Guidance**: Managers should be provided with clear guidelines to ensure equitable participation for remote team members in discussions and decision-making processes. This includes strategies to maintain a level playing field for all employees (Web Search, October 22, 2024).\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Support for Remote Work**: Employers must provide comprehensive support for remote employees to enhance productivity. This includes access to the necessary resources and a standard policy that permits flexibility in how work is performed (Web Search, June 16, 2025).\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Cultural Considerations**: Company culture in hybrid settings must be nurtured through consistent, transparent, and fair practices. Emphasizing performance and recognition equitably among all team members can help strengthen organizational culture (Web Search, October 22, 2024).\n",
            "\n",

This leave entitlement is consistent with company policy and aligns well with industry standards. \n",

        "   - Handle errors gracefully\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Multi-Source Strategy**\n",
        "   - Internal data first (CSV, PDF)\n",
        "   - External when needed (Web)\n",
