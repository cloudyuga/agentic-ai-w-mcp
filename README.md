# 🧠 Practical Agentic AI with LangGraph

Welcome to the **official GitHub repository** for the course **"Practical Agentic AI with LangGraph"** — your hands-on journey into building intelligent, autonomous systems using cutting-edge agentic AI patterns and the powerful **LangGraph** framework.

> 🚀 Learn by doing. Build real-world, multi-agent systems step-by-step — starting from the basics and ending with a complete, production-ready recruitment AI workflow.

---

## 📚 Course Overview

This course is designed to take you **from foundational concepts to advanced implementation** of agentic AI systems. Our primary focus is **practical, real-world application**, and we’ll build a fully functional **Recruitment & HR agentic system** as a capstone project.

By the end of this course, you’ll be able to:

✅ Understand the principles behind **Agentic AI** and how it differs from traditional architectures
✅ Build **stateful, autonomous agents** using [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph)
✅ Design **ReAct agents** (Reason + Act) for dynamic decision-making
✅ Manage **state, memory, and multi-agent conversation flows**
✅ Deploy **complex workflows** by integrating multiple agentic components into a single system
