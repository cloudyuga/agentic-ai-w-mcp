Practical Agentic AI with LangGraph
Welcome to the official GitHub repository for the "Practical Agentic AI with LangGraph" course. This repository contains all the hands-on labs, code examples, and resources you will need to successfully complete the course.

COURSE OVERVIEW
This course is designed to take you from the fundamental concepts of AI agents to building complex, multi-agent systems using LangGraph. We will focus on practical, real-world applications, using a recruitment and HR system as our primary use case.

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

Understand the core principles of agentic AI and how it differs from traditional systems.

Design and build stateful, autonomous workflows using LangGraph.

Implement advanced agent patterns like ReAct (Reasoning and Acting).

Manage state, memory, and conversations for multiple concurrent agents.

Integrate multiple agentic components into a complete, functional system.

REPOSITORY STRUCTURE
All course materials are organized into modules. Each module has its own folder containing the labs as Google Colab notebooks.

GETTING STARTED
To get started with the labs, you will need a Google account to use Google Colab and an API key from OpenAI.

Step 1: Clone the Repository
First, clone this repository to your local machine or download it as a ZIP file.

git clone https://github.com/cloudyuga/agentic-ai-w-mcp.git

Step 2: Set Up Your OpenAI API Key
All the labs that use Large Language Models require an OpenAI API key.

Go to the OpenAI API keys page to create your key.

Open any of the Google Colab notebooks from this repository.

In Colab, click on the "Key" icon (Secrets) in the left sidebar.

Create a new secret named OPENAI_API_KEY and paste your key into the value field.

Make sure to enable the "Notebook access" toggle.

Step 3: Run the Labs
Navigate into the module folders and open the .ipynb files in Google Colab. The notebooks are self-contained and include all necessary setup instructions and explanations. Run the cells in order from top to bottom.
