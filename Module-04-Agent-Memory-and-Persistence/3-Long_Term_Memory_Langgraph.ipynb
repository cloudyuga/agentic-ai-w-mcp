            "- Types of leave available (sick leave, vacation, personal leave, etc.)\n",

            "- Application procedure (e.g., online portal, paper form)\n",

            "**Example:** If your company states that vacation leave requires a two-week notice, make sure to adhere to that timeline.\n",

            "### Step 2: Determine the Leave Duration\n",
            "Decide how long you will be absent and if the leave will be continuous or intermittent. This will help you plan better and provide the necessary information in your application.\n",
