# ⚡ Functional vs. Graph API: Choosing Your LangGraph Superpower 🚀  

In **LangGraph**, you have two powerful ways to build your agentic systems:  
👉 **The Functional API**  
👉 **The Graph API**  

They can both achieve the same goals—but they represent two different philosophies of building.

## ❓ The Big Question  
**When should you write a simple recipe, and when do you need to draft a complex blueprint?**  
This guide will help you decide.

## 🏛️ The Core Analogy: Chef vs. Architect  

| API Style | Analogy | Key Traits |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| 🐍 **Functional API** | **Chef** – writes a recipe using familiar language (Python). | ✅ Fast & intuitive <br> ✅ Reads like normal Python <br> ✅ Best for linear processes & rapid prototyping |
| 🗺️ **Graph API** | **Architect** – draws a blueprint with explicit structures & connections. | ✅ Precise & controllable <br> ✅ Visual & clear <br> ✅ Best for branching, loops & complex orchestration |

## 🚀 Side-by-Side Example  
**Task:** *Screen a resume and route it to a senior, mid, or junior interview process.*  

<details>
<summary><strong>🐍 Functional API Implementation</strong></summary>

```python
# --- FUNCTIONAL API ---
# It reads like a simple script. Logic is a standard if/else block.

@task
def analyze_experience(resume: str) -> str:
    # ... logic to determine level ...

@entrypoint
def functional_route_interview(resume: str) -> str:
    level = analyze_experience(resume)
    
    # Simple, readable Python control flow
    if level == "senior":
        return "Senior interview scheduled"
    elif level == "mid":
        return "Mid-level interview scheduled"
    else:
        return "Junior interview scheduled"
````

<details>
<summary><strong>🗺️ Graph API Implementation</strong></summary>

```python
# --- GRAPH API ---
# We must explicitly define the state, nodes, and connections.

# 1. Define State
class InterviewState(TypedDict):
    # ... state fields ...

# 2. Define Node Functions
def analyze_node(state: InterviewState) -> dict:
    # ... logic to determine level ...

def senior_node(state: InterviewState) -> dict:
    # ... logic for senior process ...

# 3. Define Router Function
def route_by_level(state: InterviewState) -> str:
    return state["experience_level"]

# 4. Build the Graph
workflow = StateGraph(InterviewState)
workflow.add_node("analyze", analyze_node)
workflow.add_node("senior", senior_node)
# ... add other nodes ...

# 5. Connect the nodes with conditional logic
workflow.set_entry_point("analyze")
workflow.add_conditional_edges("analyze", route_by_level, {
    "senior": "senior", "mid": "mid", "junior": "junior"
})
# ... add final edges ...

app = workflow.compile()
```

## ✨ Feature-by-Feature Breakdown

| Feature              | 🐍 Functional API                         | 🗺️ Graph API                         |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **State Management** | Implicit (function args)                  | Explicit (`TypedDict` schema)         |
| **Control Flow**     | Python-native (`if/else`, `for`, `while`) | Graph-based (`add_conditional_edges`) |
| **Code Verbosity**   | Low (less boilerplate)                    | High (more setup required)            |
| **Visualization**    | ❌ Cannot be visualized                    | ✅ Can render diagrams                 |
| **Loops (Cycles)**   | ❌ Not possible                            | ✅ Supported                           |
| **Learning Curve**   | Easy (just Python)                        | Moderate (graph concepts needed)      |
| **Readability**      | High for simple logic                     | High for complex flows                |
| **Best For**         | Prototyping, linear tasks                 | Complex systems, orchestration        |

## ✅ Our Recommendation: Start Functional, Go Graph When Needed

For most new projects:

1. **Start with Functional API** 🐍

   * Fastest and most intuitive way to build.
   * Get a working system in **minutes**.

2. **Switch to Graph API** 🗺️ when you hit limits:

   * 🔁 Need loops? → Use Graph.
   * 🤯 If/else logic too nested? → Use Graph.
   * 🖼️ Need to show your team a diagram? → Use Graph.

---

## 🎯 Final Takeaway

By mastering both, you’ll have a **complete toolkit**:

* From **simple, linear processes** → 🐍 Functional API
* To **complex, multi-agent systems with cycles** → 🗺️ Graph API
