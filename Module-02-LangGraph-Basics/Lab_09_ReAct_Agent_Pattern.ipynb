        "#\n",
        "# **Goal:** Build a simple agent that follows the **ReAct (Reasoning and Acting)** pattern. This is a fundamental pattern for creating agents that can use tools to answer questions or accomplish tasks.\n",

        "# ## Part A: Understanding ReAct\n",
        "#\n",
        "# ReAct is a simple but powerful loop that an agent follows to achieve a goal.\n",
        "#\n",
        "# 1.  **Reason:** The agent thinks about its goal and the information it has. It forms a plan or decides what to do next. This \"thought\" is a crucial step.\n",
        "# 2.  **Act:** Based on its reasoning, the agent decides to take an action. This action is often the use of a \"tool\" (e.g., a search engine, a calculator, a database query).\n",
        "# 3.  **Observe:** The agent receives the result from the tool (the \"observation\").\n",
        "# 4.  **Repeat:** The agent takes this new observation, goes back to the **Reason** step, and continues the loop until it has enough information to achieve its goal.\n",
        "#\n",
        "# ### Example Flow for Our Recruiter Agent:\n",
        "#\n",
        "# * **Goal:** Assess the skills of a candidate.\n",
        "# * **Reasoning (Thought):** \"The resume mentions a GitHub profile. I should check it to verify their technical skills.\"\n",
        "# * **Action (Tool Call):** `search_github(username=\"john_dev\")`\n",
        "# * **Observation (Tool Result):** \"Found a GitHub profile with 50 Python repositories. Very active.\"\n",
        "# * **Reasoning (Thought):** \"The GitHub profile confirms strong Python skills. I can now finalize my assessment.\"\n",
        "# * **Action:** End the loop and provide the final answer.\n",
